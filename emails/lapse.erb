Dear <%=name%>,

We haven't received a payment from you in more than a month, and so you are no
longer a member of London Hackspace. Your door access has been automatically
revoked. If you're still storing anything in the space, you should arrange to
remove it as soon as possible, or we may dispose of it.

The last payment we received from you was on <%=date%>.

If you believe we've unsubscribed you in error, please reply to this email with
the date, amount, and reference of your most recent payment, and we'll look
into it.

If you want to re-start your membership, payment details can be found on our
web site:

https://london.hackspace.org.uk/members/

Lastly, if you have any feedback about why you've cancelled your membership, or
how we can improve London Hackspace, we'd be very interested to hear it - just
hit reply and let us know.

Thanks,

The London Hackspace trustees
