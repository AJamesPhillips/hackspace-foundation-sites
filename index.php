<p><strong>The Hackspace Foundation is a non-profit, community organisation dedicated to providing physical
spaces for hacking in the UK.</strong></p>

<p>We mean <em>hacking</em> in the <a href="http://catb.org/jargon/html/H/hacker.html">original sense</a> of the word 
&mdash; the art of making, tinkering, improving and destroying things. Nothing to do with breaking into systems 
(that's <em>cracking</em>), and not necessarily to computers or electronics.</p>

<p>Currently we've got two spaces in the early stages of formation:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="http://groups.google.com/group/london-hack-space">London Hack Space</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://groups.google.com/group/birmingham-hack-space">Birmingham Hack Space</a></li>
</ul>

<p>If you're thinking of starting a hacker space in the UK, please get in touch with us - we'd love to help you.</p>
