<p class="blurb"><strong>The London Hackspace project is working to create a permanent space in London for people to 
come and make things.</strong></p>

<p>We hold regular <a href="/events">hack evenings</a>, generally in a pub, to help build the community so people can get to know each other, 
as well as to provide a place for geeks to come and hack.</p>

<h2>We need money to make this happen</h2>

<p>Renting a place in London isn't cheap &mdash; if you're interested, <strong>please help us out</strong> by
donating using <a href="/donate">nank transfer</a> or Paypal:</p>
