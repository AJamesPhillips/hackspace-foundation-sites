come and make things.</strong></p>

<p>We're currently building up funds to be able to rent a space. If you're interested, please <a href="/donate">donate</a>!</p>

<p>We hold regular <a href="/events">hack evenings</a>, generally in a pub, to help build the community so people can get to know each other, 
as well as to provide a place for geeks to come and hack.</p>
