<h2>Donate</h2>
<p>If you're serious about using or participating in a London hack space, we suggest you 
    <a href="http://hackspace.org.uk/membership.php">join</a> the Hackspace Foundation, which is the 
    parent body of the London Hackspace. Joining the Foundation costs Â£10/month and gives you a direct 
    say in where your money goes, as well as helping us gauge how many people are seriously interested. </p>

<p>If you just want to donate, or if you want to start off your membership with a bigger amount of cash, 
    you can send us money directly.</p>
