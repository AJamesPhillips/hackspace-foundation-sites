<h2>Join Us</h2>
<p>If you want to use the space, you should
    <a href="http://hackspace.org.uk/membership.php">join</a> the Hackspace Foundation, which is the 
    parent body of the London Hackspace. Joining the Foundation requires a recommended donation of Â£20 per month
    (although you can pay less if you honestly can't afford it) and gives you a direct 
    say in where your money goes. </p>

<p>If you just want to donate, or if you want to start off your membership with a bigger amount of cash, 
    you can send us money directly.</p>
