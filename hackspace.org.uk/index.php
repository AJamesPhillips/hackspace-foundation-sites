<p class="blurb"><strong>The Hackspace Foundation is a non-profit, community organisation dedicated to providing
physical spaces for hacking in the UK.</strong></p>

<p>We mean hacking in the <a href="http://catb.org/jargon/html/H/hacker.html">original sense</a> of the word 
&mdash; the art of making, tinkering with, improving and destroying things. Nothing to do with breaking into systems 
(that&apos;s cracking), and not necessarily to do with computers or electronics.</p>

<p>Currently we've got two spaces in the early stages of formation:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="http://groups.google.com/group/london-hack-space">London Hack Space</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://groups.google.com/group/birmingham-hack-space">Birmingham Hack Space</a></li>
</ul>

<p>If you're thinking of starting a hacker space in the UK, <a href="/starting.php">we can help you</a>.</p>
